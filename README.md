# TCP-IP
Create a TCP/IP server and multiple clients for calculating distance of 3D points

1. Click on “Server.exe” and “Client.exe” to start both applications. Also, users
can start up to 6 client applications by clicking “Client.exe” multiple times.
2. If uses can not open the applications, users can also go to TCP-IP file → 
Client → bin → Debug → 2222222.exe for the client application. For the 
server application, go to TCP-IP file → Server → bin → Debug → 
11111.exe. If programmers are operating the applications, simple start in any
IDEs.
3. After starting both applications, make sure the IP addresses for both 
applications are the same. If they are not same, simply enter the local IP 
address in the field.
4. Click on the “Start Server” button first in the Server application.
5. Click on the “Connect” button on every Client application that users opened.
6. Users can enter the 6 numbers of two 3D points into the text boxes.
7. After click the “Send” button, the distance result will display on the 
“Distance” field.
8. To close the applications, simply click on the “Disconnect” button in the 
client application and “Close Server” in the server application
